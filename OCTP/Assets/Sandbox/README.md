# Sandbox

This folder is for experimentation and prototyping. 

**Purpose**: Quick tests, temporary scripts, and experimental features that aren't ready for production.

**Guidelines**:
- Feel free to create any structure here without following project conventions
- Not included in production builds (can be excluded via build settings)
- Move working code to appropriate feature folders in `_Project/`
- Clean up periodically - don't let this become a dumping ground
- Don't reference Sandbox code from production features

**What belongs here**:
- Testing new Unity features or packages
- Proof-of-concept scripts
- Temporary debug visualizations
- Learning/tutorial code

**What doesn't belong here**:
- Production game code
- Reusable utilities (those go in `_Project/Core/`)
- Assets used in actual game scenes
